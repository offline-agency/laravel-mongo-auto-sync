#Awesome! How do I contribute?
Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

##Guidelines
- Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Standard]('https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/') and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions]('https://www.php-fig.org/bylaws/psr-naming-conventions/').

- Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.

- Remember that we follow [SemVer]('https://semver.org/'). If you are changing the behaviour, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.

- Send a coherent commit history, making sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash]('https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History') them before submitting.

- You may also need to [rebase]('https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing') to avoid merge conflicts.
